## Introduction

This repository includes all the necessary code to control and operate our FRC robot. The code is written primarily in Java and is designed to run on the WPILib framework. It includes features for autonomous operations, teleoperated controls, and sensor integration to ensure peak performance during competitions.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-team/2025-FRC-Robot-Code.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```sh
   cd 2025-FRC-Robot-Code
   ```
3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```

## Usage

To deploy the code to the robot:

1. Connect to the robot's network.
2. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew deploy
   ```

This will compile and deploy the code to the robot's control system.
